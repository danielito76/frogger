## Frogger

The idea of Frogger is to guide a family of frogs across a road, and a river to their homes at the top of the screen.
To make things more challenging there are numerous moving obstacles that the frogs must avoid to reach their destination.

In order to do it we were also provided of a Readme for the instructions, a link to a possible layout and two links to a Wikipedia entry and a demonstrative Youtube video

### Introduction

Your task is to create the classic children's game Whack-a-Mole using HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

### Requirements

* Create a grid of squares
* A "mole" should randomly appear in a square every 1000 ms for 750 ms
* If the user clicks on the square containing the "mole" they should get a point
* The game should run for 60 seconds


**Note:** Remember to wrap your code in a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener.

### Bonus

* Make a start game button which starts the countdown timer, and starts the moles appearing
* Make a reset button that resets the score and the timer, ready to play again

### Bonus bonus

* Make the game mobile responsive
* Add sounds
* Add CSS animations (hint: check out [Aminate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/))
